There are 2 parts to this problem commit and push your work to github after each part (you may commit and push more often but at least after each part).
Part 1: "BegFunc2-TestCases" - Create the test cases for each of the functions described below 
        (put them in the provided functionName-TestCases.txt files, and submit all the *-TestCases.txt to mimir).
Part 2: "BegFunc2" - Create a java project, and implement the functions described below.
         After you created the functions go back and make the calls to the functions as described below.


Functions to implement
/*
Function Name: HelloWorld
Parameters: none
What it should do: 
	print "Hello, World"
Returns: nothing
*/

/*
Function Name: Hello
Parameters: a string representing a name
What it should do: 
	prints "Hello, "  and the value of the name
Returns: nothing
*/

/*
Function Name: Sum
Parameters: 3 doubles
What it should do: 
	calculate the sum of the 3 parameters
Returns: the result from adding the parameters together
*/
 
/*
Function Name: Average
Parameters: 3 doubles
What it should do: 
	calculate the average of the 3 parameters
Returns: the average
*/

/*
Function Name: Sum
Parameters: 4 integers
What it should do: 
	calculate the sum of the 4 parameters
Returns: the result from adding the parameters together
*/
 
/*
Function Name: Average
Parameters: 4 integers
What it should do: 
	calculate the average of the 4 parameters 
Returns: the average (as a double)
*/


In the main function, after creating the above functions do the following:

Call HelloWorld
Call Hello  passing in Baker for the parameter
Call Hello  passing in Pete for the parameter
Call Hello  passing in World for the parameter

Call Sum passing in 1.5,1.5,3 for the parameters and print the result returned by the call
Call Average passing in 1.5,1.5,3 for the parameters and save in a variable called X
Call Sum passing in 2,5,X for the parameters 
Call Average passing in 1,2,3,6 for the parameters and print the result
Call Sum passing in 1,2,3,4 for the parameters and print the result


Sample test cases:
